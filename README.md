# CSV_Reader
A Chrome extension that reads an onboard CSV file and displays its contents. Below are my goals for this utility.
This is a prototype of a larger project. Use only with permission.

## Step-by-step 'pseudocode'

1. Get the file path to a csv file.
2. Store the csv file data into a custom-designed object.
3. Display these objects into a browser extension window.

## Additional functionality:
a. Use html to produce a more visually appealing layout
b. Add sorting buttons that allow the user to change the output order of the csv file contents.
